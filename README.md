Playlist Parser

Paul’s MP3 player records the history of the music he listens to. The history is recorded
to a file that can be retrieved from the MP3’s flash drive.

Given the history file from Paul’s MP3 player as input, write a Java method that outputs to console the following:

- The 5 Songs listened by Paul the most

The file is formatted as follows:
- Each song listened to is recorded on a new line of the file
- The format of each line is as follows:
    artist name|song name

- Neither artist names, nor song names will contain the '|' character
